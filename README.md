# MapKitApp

### A simple MapKit application to get familiar with the framework. Built using UIKit. 
- A map is displayed in dark mode. Custom colored pins are added and a route is drawn between the pins.
- The route is obtained and parsed from a json file.
- A current location button helps user move to the current location after obtaining location permission.
